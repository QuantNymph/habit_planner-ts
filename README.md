This is a simple tool intended to help plan a weekly routine. Just clone it, go to the directory, and run 'npm start' to run the webserver. Operation is straightforward. It shows you total allocated time based on your habits table, a weekly schedule in 15m chunks, and a pie chart of your allocated vs scheduled time (unallocated time checkbox adds the rest of the time in a week). Click a pie chart section to select the habit, then click a cell. 

I made this for myself to use but I thought someone else might find it useful.
